# Slow Travel Is Chill Travel
Slow traveling is chill traveling, and it’s my preferred mode of adventure. Well, to be fair, chill is my preferred style for doing everything — it’s my default state. So that means I’ve got some keen insights to share!

This is my guide on how to enjoy relaxed, slow travel. Because slow-paced, carefree travel means less stress and more fun. This is how travel should be.  
Alright, let’s do this!
## What Is Slow Travel?
Slow travel is slower-paced travel, like spending more time in a location to let yourself experience it more fully. It’s letting yourself connect with a culture on a deeper, more personal level. Slow traveling is the opposite of trying to cram as much as you can into a trip, and it allows you to go with the flow more.

This means no rushing to check off boxes on some itinerary or a perfectly crafted schedule. Slow traveling focuses on connecting more deeply with yourself and your destination by letting things unfold as they will (and relinquishing your control).

You’ll find plenty of type B personalities embracing this style of traveling since it’s more chill and, well, more slow-paced.
